This is a VisualStudio 2019 solution, although it can be opened by any successive VS release. 

To run the built application, simply run the executable on a Windows device, or a Linux machine with Wine. The source code is available through opening the solution in a VisualStudio IDE. 

Note that this is a mocked up application, and while the interface is functional, it has no direct links to the python processes, and therefore it is not necessary to run this alongside any of the other python scripts included in the GitHub.
